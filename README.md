## Some cool stuff

I'll gist about this later... but it's coming alright...

```php
/* Some Php code will be here... It's just classes 
 mostly */
```

> Also (Just a sidenote), I personally find this a lot easier to understand and build than `NodeJS` & `Express` APIs.

## Features in Development
Some Ideas in my head: 

* 💻 Refactoring in ES6 instead of jQuery (Using `Fetch` & `Async Await`) 
* ⚛️ Front-End Implementation with `React`, `Vue` or `Angular`
* 📷 Handling File and Image Upload (User profiles etc)
